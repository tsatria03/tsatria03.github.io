<h1> What is an audio game? </h1>

<p> An audio game is basicly an electronic version of your classic video game played on a computer or mobile device. Think of it like a game that has no visual elements or graffics being presented on the screen. Instead of high end graffics, audio games are accompanied by sound to help convey blind and visually impaired audience threw a world of ritch atmospeeric seens and diverce lanscapes that make it seem like you're actualy there when playing it. </p>

<h1> What are audio games comprised of? </h1>

<p> Audio games come in several different variations. I'll breefely go into all of the cattigories that most blind and visually impaired people play on a daily basis, or on there free time. </p>

<h2> Action games </h2>

<p> Action games require the player to use their reflexes, aim and skill, often in the context of combat or overcoming obstacles and dangers. Within this broad genre are several highly popular subgenres, such as shooting games, fighting games, arcade games, and platform games, among others. </p>

<h2> Adventure games </h2>

<p> Adventure games are a genre of video games, characterized by investigation, exploration, puzzle solving, interaction with game characters, and a focus on storytelling rather than reflex-based challenges. There are different types of adventure games, such as audio adventures, where you will only be guided by sound to play, or first-person adventures, where you have the expectation of playing from a full 3d approach. Unlike many other video game genres, adventure genres' focus on a story allows them to borrow elements from other narrative-heavy media, such as literature and movies. Adventure video games span a wide variety of literary genres, including fantasy, science fiction, mystery, horror, detective, and comedy. Almost all adventure games are designed for a single player, as there is a strong emphasis on story and character, making multiplayer design difficult. </p>

<h2> Arcade games </h2>

<p> Arcade games are characterized by their simple, repetitive, and fast-action gameplay. It is also said that a game is "arcade" type to mean that, as opposed to other games of the same genre that pursue great realism or sophistication (such as vehicle simulation or war games), are characterized by gameplay, a quality and/or a simpler argument. Many times they are to test your reaction speed and concentration, your skill and agility and so on. </p>

<h2> Board games </h2>

<p> These are dice games, token games, games that in their physical version are usually played with a board and pieces. A board game is a game that is generally played on a table or similar support and is played by one or, more commonly, several people around it. It may require players to use tactical or strategic reasoning, coordination, manual dexterity, memory, deductive ability, psychology, negotiating skills, or simply be based on pure chance. Obviously, the board games here are audio games, that is, they are not physical, but are played digitally. </p>

<h2> Card Games </h2>

<p> Card games are played with cardboard, called cards, which form a deck and must be mixed (shuffled) before playing. Add-ons are used in certain games to place bets or keep scores. </p>

<h2> Educational games </h2>

<p> The main purpose of Educational games is to teach, exercise or be of help for the development of some of the player's abilities. Normally these include interactive activities that help the understanding of new topics for the user. These types of games are very Didactic, and are focused on the smallest players, in order to help them in their learning, but they do it interactively, using a game in between. </p>

<h2> First person shooters </h2>

<p> In first person shooter games, also known as FPS, the protagonist is handled from a subjective perspective, that is, we see on the screen what our character sees, and therefore we do not see him. Instead, we do see his weapon, in the foreground, which we must use to kill the different enemies that will appear in front of us as we advance. The first person perspective, in a 3D environment, aims to give the player the impression of being the character, thereby seeking a more realistic gaming experience. The mechanics of the gameplay (or gameplay) generally requires the player to have good reflexes and precision. The definition above is fps in general, in the field of audio games, one has the first person perspective, but is guided by the audio, which is mostly stereo, and you have to center the sound of the enemies to be able to shoot them and kill them. </p>

<h2> Fighting games </h2>

<p> Fighting games, as their name suggests, recreate combat between characters controlled by both a player and a computer. The player normally sees the combatants from a side perspective, as if they were a spectator, although there are also exceptions that handle 3D and first person environments. These types of games place special emphasis on martial arts, real or fictional (generally impossible to imitate), or other types of unarmed confrontations such as boxing or wrestling. Other video games also allow the use of bladed weapons such as swords, axes, hammers, etc., or remote attacks, usually of a magical or ethereal nature. </p>

<h2> Gamebooks and Visual Novels </h2>

<p> Gamebooks are interactive novels where the author intends to involve the reader in the story, giving him the chance to choose different actions that set the course of the story. In other words, a gamebook is not read from beginning to end, but rather stops at various times, leaving the reader the decision of what to do at that moment, giving him different options and alternatives that he can choose as he prefers. Some gamebooks allow you to create your own character to play, or the game might even let you read without choosing any specific options. Visual novels also start from this premise, but they are not necessarily presented in book format. Unlike gamebooks, they are usually much more interactive and include music, sound environments and, sometimes, voice actors that play the different characters, as well as a combination of static or animated images that illustrate the different scenes. In addition to branching visual novels, which often have several different routes and endings depending on the player's decisions. Kinetic novels also fall into this category, where we just progress through the story without making any significant changes. As these types of games mainly focus on narrative and character development, their gameplay is mostly based on reading and decision making. This means that in many cases they are accessible to the blind. Some are native, while others require the use of OCR or small mods. </p>

<h2> Horror games </h2>

<p> A horror game is the one whose main objective is to scare the user, be it with psychological terror, with a terrifying environment or in many other ways. Normally these games are not recommended for players under 16 years of age, since the purpose of the games is to scare and cause a lot of fear to the user. These games have a plot or secondary story, which serves to complement the main theme, which, as already said, is to terrify the player as much as possible. The best-known type of game in this genre is survival horror. </p>

<h2> Interactive Fiction and Text Adventures </h2>

<p> These types of games are usually very accessible because they only use the text as a reference to play. An interactive fiction game is a game that is based on only text, the player must enter all the orders and actions that he wishes to perform through writing or selecting options. Once this is done, the game describes what happened. Sometimes these games lack sound and graphics, so they only have text. </p>

<h2> MMORPGs </h2>

<p> Massively multiplayer online role-playing games, or MMORPGs, are role-playing video games that allow thousands of players to enter a virtual world simultaneously through the Internet and interact with each other. . They consist, at first, in the creation of a character, from which the player can choose race, profession, weapons, etc. Once the character is created, the player can introduce it into the game and increase levels and experience in PvP (Character vs. Character) or PvE (Character vs. Environment) fights or by carrying out various adventures or missions, usually called quests (literally: "quests" in English). This genre of video games differs from a non-massively multiplayer online role-playing game in that the latter have a limited number of players, that is, MMORPGs are prepared and elaborated in such a way that they admit any number of simultaneous players (although in practice is limited by the server connection). While MMORPGs can have a lot of single player content, they are primarily meant for interaction with other players. </p>

<h2> Muds </h2>

<p> MUD is the acronym for Multi User Dungeon. A MUD is an online role-playing video game running on a server. It is the base from which current MMORPGs start. This kind of game is generally accessed through a telnet connection between the client, the player's machine that wants to connect, and the server itself. To access the mud it is not necessary to have specific applications, being able to use basic terminals already installed that support the telnet protocol, like those that we can find in the distributions of the operating systems or using software designed exclusively for this kind of games. Basically the player can create a character known by the name of PJ or player character, for which he must create a file that will be filled by obtaining scores in virtual rolls on the PJ's basic statistics, such as strength, dexterity, intelligence , charisma, wisdom and constitution. Most of the muds provide an alphanumeric game mode, which implies that the player receives all the information from the server in text mode. This information is obtained by executing an action within the game and is basically represented by descriptions of the room where the PJ is located, of objects, of the inventory, of the token, of the character's state, etc. The player interacts with the world and NPCs or NPCs (Non Playing Characters or mobs, all those characters not controlled by the player. </p>

<h2> Puzzel  and lojic games </h2>

<p> Logic audio games, also known as intelligence games or puzzle games, are a genre of video games that are characterized by demanding mental agility from the player. They can involve logic problems, math, strategy, pattern recognition, word completion, or even simple randomness. The genre can be hard to describe, each one has its own unique style. </p>

<h2> RPGs </h2>

<p> role playing games are characterized by character interaction, a deep story, and character evolution as the story progresses. To achieve evolution, the player is generally involved in an adventure where he will meet new characters, exploring the world to gather weapons, experience, allies and even magic. Although most adventure games include a low dose of RPG, pure role-playing video games focus specifically on increasing the protagonist's skills and experience, and on a high degree of customization. Classic RPGs, inspired by board games, battle in turns, that is, the player uses his equipment and learned skills to attack through a series of commands and then must remain static and wait to receive the other player's attack or CPU. However, there are many rpg games that use real-time combat, that is, there are no pauses and both opponents attack each other at the same time. </p>

<h2> Racing Games </h2>

<p> A racing game is a game in which competitions between vehicles are imitated. Usually the goal is to travel a certain distance or get from one place to another in the shortest time possible, as in motor racing and motorcycling (which are generally imitated). </p>

<h2> Side scrollers </h2>

<p> In these games, your character is represented in 2 dimensions with stereo sound, and objects like enemies or pits appear as you move (usually to the right). While these games often feature action or an arcade style, other times they have more complex mechanics like the ability to increase stats or equip different weapons. However if a game is a side scroller, it is certain that left to right side scrolling in a 2 dimensional stereo field will be an important part of it. There are also side scroller games that are more complex and developed, like the famous platformers or Beat 'em ups. </p>

<h2> Shoot 'em up games </h2>

<p> The shoot 'em up is a type of shooting game with a two-dimensional perspective, where we usually drive a spaceship (in games popularly known as "martian killer"), although it can also be another type of vehicle or a character. Characteristics of this genre are the continuous use of shooting, the different types of weapons, or the improvement of the available ones, automatic vertical or lateral scrolling, and confrontations with large bosses at the end of each mission. Even though they are 2D games, sometimes 3D elements are included or combined to give depth effects, explosions or more visual effect, especially with boss enemies. </p>

<h2> Simulation games </h2>

<p> This genre is characterized by recreating real-world situations or activities, letting the player take control of what happens. Sometimes the simulation seeks a high degree of credibility, which gives it a didactic component. The most popular types of simulation are vehicle management (driving a car, a plane, a train...), construction (building a city, an amusement park or an empire), or life (directing the life of a person or a virtual animal). </p>

<h2> Sports games </h2>

<p> Sports games are those that simulate real world sports. Among them we find golf, tennis, soccer, baseball, etc. The game mechanics are the same as in the original sport, although sometimes it incorporates some additions or restrictions. They can be subdivided into the following types: arcade, simulator and manager. </p>

<h2> Strategy games </h2>

<p> These are characterized by the need to manipulate a large group of characters, objects or data, making use of intelligence and planning, to achieve the objectives. Although most of these games are fundamentally war-themed, there are also economic, business or social strategy games. Two large subgenres are real-time strategy (also called RTS) and turn-based (TBS) games. The first are games where the results of the strategy used are immediate, while in the second you have to wait for the opponent's action to find out what the result of your attack was. </p>

<h2> Trivia games </h2>

<p> These games are basically to test your knowledge in a specific area or several, since they are questions and answers, sometimes with options to choose from, sometimes with true or false, etc. </p>

<h2> Word Games </h2>

<p> Word games are understood as hobbies that use words and or letters in such a way that they produce a certain playful and often also educational effect, since they supposedly favor the development of creativity and language skills, such as writing and spelling, while allowing the player to become familiar with an ever-widening vocabulary. Most word games require sharp thinking and this is why it is believed that developing this type of activity helps to maintain a more active mind, since with the game, these qualities are increasingly perfected. </p>
